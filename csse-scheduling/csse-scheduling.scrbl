 Given a quarter such as 2188, return the corresponding year (in this case,
 2018).
}

@defproc[(qtr->season [qtr Natural]) String]{
 Given a quarter such as 2188, return the corresponding season (in this case,
 "Fall").

 Given a year such as 2004 and a season such as "Winter", return
 the corresponding quarter number (in this case, 2042).

@defproc[(season-after-qtr [season String] [qtr Natural]) Natural]{
  Given a season such as "Spring" and a quarter such as 2188, return the
  first quarter on or after the given quarter of the given season (in
  this case, 2194).

 Given a year such as 2017, return a catalog cycle such as "2017-2019".
 Note that the "fall" part is important, since, for instance, Spring 2017
 maps to the "2015-2017" catalog.}
